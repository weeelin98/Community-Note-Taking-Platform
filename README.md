# Community-Note-Taking-Platform

Not really sure the name of it lol(for now!)
Inspired by the golden age of internet forums, this project is a personal tribute to those formative online spaces that shaped how I learned, shared, and connected. I’m building a modern community-driven note-taking platform that captures the collaborative spirit of classic forums while embracing today’s web technologies.

Tech Stack: Spring Boot, MySQL, Redis, React, TypeScript
